MicroInject is simple Dependency Injection framework made for Unity Engine that allows you to easily inject components.
<br>
<br>
Features:
<br>

- Runtime injection
- In-editor injection - injecting dependencies without any runtime performance impact
- Named dependencies - injecting dependencies that can be named (Useful when we have couple dependencies that have the same type)
- Dynamically named dependencies (or for short Dynamic dependencies) - the same as above but name can be changed during runtime (Useful when we want to inject specific player data based on a name that can change during runtime)

Roadmap:
<br>
- v1.1.0  - add support for injecting ScriptableObjects
- v1.2.0  - add support for injecting gameobjects
